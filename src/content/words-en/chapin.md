### Etymology

The term "chapín" comes from the old Spanish word referring to a type of wooden clog shoe with a cork platform that was popular in Spain during the 16th century. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Guatemala, the indigenous people started calling them "chapines" because of these distinctive shoes they wore.

Over time, the term evolved and became the colloquial way to refer to Guatemalans in general, losing its original meaning related to footwear.

### Usage

"Chapín" is used as both a noun and an adjective to describe people, things, or customs from Guatemala. It's a term of pride for Guatemalans and is widely used both within the country and abroad by the Guatemalan diaspora.

The word is always used with affection and pride, never as a derogatory term.

### Regional variations

- In Guatemala: Universal term for Guatemalan
- Outside Guatemala: Used by Guatemalan communities abroad to identify themselves
- The feminine form is "chapina"
